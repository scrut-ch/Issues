# Issues of _scrutch_

If you found some strange behaviour within _scrutch_ or even a bug in plain sight, please take the time to report it here.

**Important:** In case of security/privacy related issues, please hesitate prior to reporting it publicly on GitHub. Maybe a more descrete way by contacting me directly via hello@scrut.ch would be wiser.

You may also use this to request new features. However, I may take the freedom to ignore/close them completely.

Good luck to us all!
